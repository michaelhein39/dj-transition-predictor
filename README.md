# DJ Transition Predictor
A supervised learning framework that predicts control signals to generate DJ transitions between tracks.

## Training Results
Observe the results of our single sample training through these audio files:

- S1.wav: The outgoing song over the transition region.
- S2.wav: The incoming song over the transition region.
- ground_truth.wav: The real DJ transition that we aim to replicate.
- prediction.wav: The final predicted transition.
